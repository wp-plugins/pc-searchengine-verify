PC Search Engine Verify enables you to easily add meta tags to your home page to confirm ownership of your domain for Google, Bing and Yahoo webmaster tools.

== Description ==

To access extended information about your website, the 3 major search engines require you to confirm ownership. One of the methods they allow you to use, is to add a meta tag to the head section of your home page.

The meta tag must contain a unique identifier, provided to you in the webmaster tools area of each search engine.

Once you've added the meta tag to your website's home page, the search engine will crawl your site to confirm ownership.

This usually gives you access to extended information about your website, such as incoming links, referrers, traffic ..etc.

Of course you can add meta tags to your site by hand, but that would mean editing your WordPress theme files - not the best way of doing these things.

With this plugin there's no editing of files, just upload, activate, and add the meta tag info on the plugin options page. All done.

== Installation ==

The easiest way is to go to your blog admin pages and under the Plugins menu, choose Add New.

Click the Search menu link, type in something like "search engine verify" and hopefully you will see PC Search Engine Verify plugin in the list. On the right should be a link to install it.

Alternatively, download the zip file to your computer, visit your blog admin pages, and under the Plugins menu choose Upload. Browse to the plugin zip file you downloaded, select it, install and activate it.

If you're a bit old fashioned, you can still download the plugin zip file, unzip it, FTP the plugin folder and all it's contents to your WordPress plugins folder, and then activate it manually from the Plugins page.

Once you have the plugin installed and activated, you'll see a new PC Search Engine Verify menu link under the Settings menu. Click that to see the plugin options page. From there you can add the content of your meta tags.
