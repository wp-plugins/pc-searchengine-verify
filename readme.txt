PC Search Engine Verify enables you to easily add meta tags to your home page to confirm ownership of your domain for Google, Bing and Yahoo webmaster tools.

== Description ==

To access extended information about your website, the 3 major search engines require you to confirm ownership. One of the methods they allow you to use, is to add a meta tag to the head section of your home page.

The meta tag must contain a unique identifier, provided to you in the webmaster tools area of each search engine.

Once you've added the meta tag to your website's home page, the search engine will crawl your site to confirm ownership.

This usually gives you access to extended information about your website, such as incoming links, referrers, traffic ..etc.

Of course you can add meta tags to your site by hand, but that would mean editing your WordPress theme files - not the best way of doing these things.

With this plugin there's no editing of files, just upload, activate, and add the meta tag info on the plugin options page under your Settings menu. All done.

== Installation ==

Once you have the plugin installed and activated, under your blog Settings menu, you'll see a new menu item called PC Search Engine Verify. Click that menu item for the plugin options page, where you can enter the meta tag information provided by the webmaster tools for your domain.
